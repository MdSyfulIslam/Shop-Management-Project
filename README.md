## 🔍 Project Overview

This Shop Management System is a **console-based application** that provides functionalities like:

- Adding items to inventory
- Searching for products
- Checking for expired items
- Recording sales
- Displaying inventory status
- Storing transaction history

The system was built to automate traditional manual shop management and enhance **accuracy**, **efficiency**, and **user experience**.

---

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Add, update, and search inventory items
- ✅ Record sales transactions with quantity validation
- ✅ Maintain transaction logs with timestamp
- ✅ Expiry date checker with notifications
- ✅ Efficient binary search for inventory lookup
- ✅ Structured and modular code

---

## ⚙️ Algorithms Used

The application implements the following algorithms:

1. **Binary Search** – For quick item lookup by code  
2. **Date Comparison** – To identify expired items  
3. **Add Item Algorithm** – Adds item details to the inventory  
4. **Search Item Algorithm** – Finds an item using its code  
5. **Item Expiry Check Algorithm** – Marks and notifies expired items  
6. **Sell Item Algorithm** – Validates quantity, updates stock, records the sale

---

## 🖥️ Simulation & Testing

The system was tested using a simulated environment where:

- Sample inventory datasets were created
- Sales operations were recorded
- Expiry and availability conditions were verified
- All functionalities worked as expected with proper edge-case handling

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Language:** C / C++ (for console-based logic)
- **Concepts:** Data Structures, Searching Algorithms
- **IDE:** Code::Blocks / Dev C++ or similar

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add multi-user access with authentication
- Integrate a GUI using Qt or Tkinter
- Extend to web/mobile platforms
- Advanced reporting: sales graphs, restock alerts
- Integrate with POS devices or barcode scanners
